# social_investment_analytical_layer v1.0.0
Standardised tables for doing cross agency work in the IDI

# Overview
The SIU has created a Social Investment Analytical Layer (SIAL): events-structured tables that arrange a version of the data held in [Statistics New Zealand's IDI](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/snapshots-of-nz/integrated-data-infrastructure.aspx) into a consistent format, making it easier and faster for authorised IDI users (researchers and analysts) to use and understand.

The SIAL is designed to be reusable. It reformats most of the social sector tables available in the IDI into tables based on events (events-structured). For most tables available in the IDI there is a corresponding events structured table.

Expect warnings around the quoted string being processed becoming more than 262 characters long. This is because the pricing table queries are read in as strings. This does not have a material impact on the generation of the pricing table.

# Folder descriptions
**SIAL_dependencies:** this folder contains the main_sial.sas script that builds all tables/views. It also contains cost data that isn't available in the IDI along with code to load these files in to SQL.  
**SIAL_bqa_complete:** this folder contains scripts that have been reviewed by the corresponding agencies.  
**SIAL_bqa_incomplete:** this folder contains scripts that are currently being reviewed by the corresponding agencies.  
**SIAL_log:** This folder is used to store the output logs that SAS generates. Since SAS does not have easy to use error handling the logs are written to file and scanned for errors.  
**SIAL_docs:** This folder contains the data dictionary for the SIAL and an overview of the datasets timeline.

# Installation
1. Download the zip file containing the SIAL scripts from github.
2. Email the zipped file to access2microdata@stats.govt.nz and ask them to move it into your project folder.
3. Unzip the files into your project.
4. Paste the social_investment_analytical_layer-master folder into the top level of your project folder and rename it social_investment_analytical_layer.
5. Open  main_sial.sas (located in the SIAL_dependencies folder) in SAS EG.
6. At the top of the main_sial.sas script there are two macro variables called `targetschema` and `sial_code_path`.
7. Change the `targetschema` to the location you wish to write your files to e.g. the SIU project schema is DL-MAA2016-15.
8. Change the `sial_code_path` to the location where you stored the scripts on the network E.g. for the SIU our location is \\...\MAA2016-15 Supporting the Social Investment Unit\social_investment_analytical_layer.

**Note that each time you run main_sial.sas it will uninstall all the SIAL tables you currently have before creating the SIAL tables**
